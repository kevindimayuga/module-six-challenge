# Module 6 Challenge - Web APIs Code Quiz

This repo is for module six's challenge assignment.

## Description

The challenge is an Job-seeking coding assessment or take-home assignment (no starter code is provided, we will build this web application by scratch). The goal is to create an application of a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code and the use of Web APIs. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

The motivation behind this project was to learn how to utilize all the previous skills we have learned as well as the utilization of Web APIs we've been learning. I built this project in order to hone my own skills in HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript and Web APIs. The problem it solved is creating a timed coding quiz application to work on the coding skills I've learned in the bootcamp thus far.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```
